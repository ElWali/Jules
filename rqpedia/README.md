# RQpedia

RQpedia is a lightweight, open-source platform for exploring archaeological data.

## Development

To run the application locally, start a simple Python HTTP server from the root of the repository:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory rqpedia &
```

You can then access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.
